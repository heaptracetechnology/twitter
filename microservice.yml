    help: |
      Returns a cursored collection of user objects for users following the specified user.

      At this time, results are ordered with the most recent following first — however, this ordering is subject to unannounced change and eventual consistency issues. Results are given in groups of 20 users and multiple “pages” of results can be navigated through using the `next_cursor` value in subsequent requests.

      handle:
        type: string
        help: The screen name of the user for whom to return results.
      user:

        help: The ID of the user for whom to return results.

      skip_status:
        type: boolean
